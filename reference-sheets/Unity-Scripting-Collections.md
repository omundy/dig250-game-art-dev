## Reference Sheet - Unity C# Scripting - Collections

* Storing and using data in multiples and collections


### Terminology

Term | Definition
--- | ---
[Serialization](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Serialization.html) | The process of converting the state of an object to a set of bytes in order to store the object into memory, a database or a file.
[Deserialization](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/VivekTank/20180731/323248/Introduction_to_Unity_Serialization_and_Game_Data.php) | The reverse process of building an object out of a file, converting text/binary data into usable datatypes in code.




### Classes

* Like a blueprint for a specific object
* Helps group and define data and the functionality for an object
* Can hold all types of properties, fields, events, method etc.
* Reference type (not copied). When you pass a class (or object from it) it is passed as a reference


### Structs

* Useful for holding small data values
* Structs are value types (so faster than a class object). When you pass a struct, it creates a copy of the data.
* Easier to transfer a class object than a struct so do not use struct when you are passing data across the wire or to other classes
* Can contain parameterized constructor, static constructor, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events and nested types

```C#
public struct NPC
{
    // fields
    public string Title;
    public bool GoodGuy;
    // constructor
    public NPC(string _Title, bool _GoodGuy)
    {
        Title = _Title;
        GoodGuy = _GoodGuy;
    }
}
// create instance using constructor
NPC badguy1 = new NPC(1, "Dr. Evil", false);
// test
Console.Write(badguy1.Name); // prints Dr. Evil
```


### Arrays

* Can contain elements of any data type
* Stores a sequential collection of values of the same type
* Length is fixed, unchangeable, and can be specified or inferred
* Use index number to access values (below, `colors[1] = "green"`)

```C#
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class Array : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string[] colors = new string[] { "red", "green", "blue" };

    void Start()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < colors.Length; i++)
        {
            Debug.Log("Array " + i + " = " + colors[i]);
        }
    }
}
```


### ArrayList

* A non-generic type of collection
* Stores objects of any type like an array
* Unlike an array, you don't need to specify the size as it grows automatically as you add items in it

```C#
IList arrayList = new ArrayList() { 100, "Two", 12.5, 200 };
arrayList.Add("hello");
print (myArryList[4]); // prints "hello"
```


### Lists

* The List<T> collection is the same as an ArrayList except that List<T> is a generic collection
* Stores a sequential collection of values of the same type
* Length is adjustable
* You can easily add and remove elements from a List

```C#
IList<int> intList = new List<int>();
intList.Add(10);
print (intList[0]); // prints 10
```


### Dictionaries

* Dictionaries store a collection of Keys and Values
* The Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class is a generic collection class in the System.Collection.Generics namespace.
* TKey denotes the type of key and TValue is the type of TValue.

```C#
// create dictionary
Dictionary<string, string> dict = new Dictionary<string, string>();
// add to key=value
dict.Add("greeting","hello world!");
// confirm it contains key and print
if ( dict.ContainsKey("greeting") ){
    print (dict["greeting"]);
}
```



### Scriptable Objects

- Data containers specific to Unity that can be saved as assets in a project
- Can also be used to help serialize objects and can be instantiated in a scene

```C#
using UnityEngine;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "Data", menuName = "ScriptableObjects/ThingManagerScriptableObject", order = 1)]
public class ThingManagerScriptableObject : ScriptableObject
{
    public int numberOfThings; // edit in the Inspector for the instance
}

public class Thing : MonoBehaviour
{
    // An instance of the ScriptableObject defined above.
    public ThingManagerScriptableObject thingManagerValues;

    void Start()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < thingManagerValues.numberOfThings; i++)
        {
            print ("Thing Number " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

### Sharing data across components, objects, scenes, etc.

* There are several ways to do this, depending on the complexity of your project.


0. Scriptable Objects (above) are a great way to architect and share data across your game. See:

- [Achieve better Scene workflow with ScriptableObjects](https://blog.unity.com/technology/achieve-better-scene-workflow-with-scriptableobjects) (2020)
- [Unity Atoms â€” Tiny modular pieces utilizing the power of Scriptable Objects](https://medium.com/@adamramberg/unity-atoms-tiny-modular-pieces-utilizing-the-power-of-scriptable-objects-e8add1b95201) (2018)



1. To get data from one script from another
* potentially the simplest way
* violates the Single Responsibility Principle (the S in [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID))
```C#
// attached to Enemy GameObject
public class EnemyScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float damage;
}
public class GameController : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start() {
        // note: this is the least efficient method to find an object in the scene
        GameObject enemy = GameObject.Find ("Enemy");
        EnemyScript enemyScript = enemy.GetComponent <EnemyScript> ();
        float enemyDamage = enemyScript.damage;
    }
}
```


2. To send a message to all scripts *attached to the same object* use [Component.SendMessage()](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Component.SendMessage.html)


The following allow you to make data accessible to all objects, across all scenes (globally)...


3. Use fields in a public static class
* This is good for data only. Classes using this CANNOT have methods attached.
```c#
public static class Globals
{
    public static int Score = 1000;
    public static float AnotherField = 1.0f;    
}
// and then use like
Globals.Score += 100;
```


4. [Observer design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)

* This is not technically a way to share data but a way to send messages between different objects.
* A software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
* Mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software, in a way that encourages "decoupling" of objects (there aren't a lot of dependencies that can be broken if name or position changes)
* See this Unity tutorial [Create a Simple Messaging System with Events](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/create-a-simple-messaging-system-with-events) (also this [variation](https://medium.com/@johntucker_48673/discovering-unity-eventmanager-a040285d0690) using the same EventManager class from Unity)
* MSDN: [Observer design pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/observer-design-pattern?redirectedfrom=MSDN)


5. [Singleton design pattern](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Singleton)
* Used with DontDestroyOnLoad
* Classes using this can also have methods

6. [PlayerPrefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html) (also preserves data for the next time game is run)

### JSON

JSON [provides many advantages over Scriptable Objects](https://answers.unity.com/questions/1447032/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-scriptableobjects-vs.html).

See [Unity-Scripting-Collections-JSON.md](Unity-Scripting-Collections-JSON.md) for an in-depth look at using JSON data in your Unity project.
