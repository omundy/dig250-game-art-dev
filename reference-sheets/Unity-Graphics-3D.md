## Reference Sheet - Graphics > 3D Objects


3D rendering in Unity uses Meshes, Materials, Shaders and Textures. These assets have a close relationship, and are often encapsulated in a single model.







![material](../assets/img/material.jpg)

A material contains properties and textures, and shaders dictate what properties and textures a material can have.



### Terminology

Term | Definition
--- | ---
Model | A package containing the mesh, materials, shaders, textures, and optionally, animations and skeleton (animation rig) for a 3D character or object.
Mesh | The main graphics primitive of Unity that defines the **shape** of an object.
[Mesh Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html) | The component that displays the geometry and material of a 3D game object.
Material | Defines **how** a surface should be rendered. Using options defined in the shader,  referenced textures and their tiling settings, and lighting in the scene, a material controls what the surface looks like, including its color tint and how shiny or smooth it appears.
Shader | Small scripts that contain mathematical calculations and algorithms for calculating the color of each pixel rendered, based on the lighting and the material configuration.
[Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Textures.html) | Any bitmap image in Unity that, when placed on a [Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Materials.html) and attached to a 3D object. Represent **what** is on a materialâ€™s surface.
